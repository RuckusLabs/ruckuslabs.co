        <p>When I first joined the Lawline team, I stepped into a brand new role as a full-time designer. I jumped in right away tackling redesigns of two core products: the course details and bundles pages. These pieces were an evolution of existing content, a collection of best practices from the industry, and a visual overlay to tie it in with Lawlineâ€™s visual language.</p>
