When I first interviewed the founder, Kyle, about how he wanted to position his brand, he responded with high-energy. His mission was to create an accessible platform for New Yorkers (and since, much beyond that market) to get out of the city and find adventure.</p>\n        <p>Competitors were surprisingly sparse. There were many that offered day-trips within the city, but few who ventured further out than that. Since then, Sourced Adventures has come a long way - now offering international destinations and even private trips for those looking for a more tailored experience.</p>\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <h2>Branding & Logo</h2>\n        <p>Branding was an important aspect of the Sourced Adventures product. The founder, himself, sketched out what he had in mind for a logo which I then took and transformed into the current logo. We've since worked together through minor updates and modernizing, but the core logo remains very similar to launch.</p>\n        <p>The logo is meant to invoke the \"get out there\" mentality. Skiing was an important piece of early Sourced Adventure trips and we wanted to pay homage to the beginning.</p>\n        <ShowcaseGrid items={designSystemItems} />\n      </section>\n      <section>\n        <h2>Creating a Lifestyle</h2>\n        <p>Brands like Sourced Adventures are fun because they allow for some pretty outlandish design language. When we turned to the website, we knew we wanted to bring that same high-energy of the trips and logo into the trip-browsing experience.</p>\n        <p>High quality trip photos combine with modern typography to invoke a \"roughing it\" feel. We wanted to convey the rawness that comes with adventuring while blending the comfort of having a seasoned guide by your side the whole time.</p>\n        <ShowcaseGrid items={courseCatalogItems} />\n      </section>\n      <BrowseMore />\n    </Layout>\n\n  )\n}","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/lawline-web-hero-61d682cc256b2d155dd7ae0d1c7dba55.jpg\";"],"names":["WorkPage","pageTitle","location","title","className","workStyles","style","backgroundImage","HeroImage","items"],"sourceRoot":""}
